# recipe-scraper

Hello and welcome to the recipe scraper. Very simple script, as a part of an assignment. Specifically scrapes this: https://www.allrecipes.com/
My goal was to scrape the data of the recipies for lunch into a csv file, so that I can later sort it based on protein or other factors. And then visit the link.

I start first with scraping the recipe type page, I chose specifically lunch but please see more [here](https://www.allrecipes.com/). 
What I was looking for was the links to each individual recipe page, so that I can loop through those and then get the title and gross nutritional facts about the dish.

Things I would improve:
Well, I am sure I can make it in such a way, that I could scrape the entire website, to get a CSV file of all of the recipes, just not sure how to do that yet.
